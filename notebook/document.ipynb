Objective \\n \\nIn this assignment, you will work with a simple web crawler to measure aspects of a crawl, study the \\ncharacteristics of the crawl, download web pages from the crawl and gather webpage metadata, all \\nfrom pre-selected news websites. \\n \\n2. Preliminaries \\n \\nTo begin we will make use of an existing open source Java web crawler called crawler4j. This crawler \\nis built upon the open source crawler4j library which is located on github. For complete details on \\ndownloading and compiling see  \\n \\nAlso see the document “Instructions for Installing Eclipse and Crawler4j” located on the Assignments \\nweb page for help. \\nNote:  You can use any IDE of your choice. But we have provided installation instructions for Eclipse \\nIDE only \\n \\n3. Crawling \\n \\nYour task is to configure and compile the crawler and then have it crawl a news website. In the interest \\nof distributing the load evenly and not overloading the news servers, we have pre-assigned the news \\nsites to be crawled according to your USC ID number, given in the table below. \\n \\nThe maximum pages to fetch can be set in crawler4j and it should be set to 20,000 to ensure a \\nreasonable execution time for this exercise. Also, maximum depth should be set to 16 to ensure that \\nwe limit the crawling. \\n \\nYou should crawl only the news websites assigned to you, and your crawler should be configured so \\nthat it does not visit pages outside of the given news website!  \\n \\nUSC ID ends with News Sites to Crawl \\nNe\\nwsS\\nite \\nNa\\nme \\nRoot URL \\n01~20 \\nNY Times \\nnytimes \\nhttps://www.nytimes.com \\n21~40 \\nWall Street Journal \\nwsj \\nhttps://www.wsj.com \\n41~60 \\nFox News \\nfoxnews \\nhttps://www.foxnews.com \\n61~80 \\nUSA Today \\nusatoday \\nhttps://www.usatoday.com \\n81~00 \\nLos Angeles Times \\nlatimes \\nhttps://www.latimes.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLimit your crawler so it only visits HTML, doc, pdf and different image format URLs and record the \\nmeta data for those file types'),\n",

Collecting Statistics \\n \\nYour primary task is to enhance the crawler so it collects information about: \\n1. the URLs it attempts to fetch, a two column spreadsheet, column 1 containing the URL and \\ncolumn 2 containing the HTTP/HTTPS status code received; name the file fetch_NewsSite.csv \\n(where the name “NewsSite” is replaced by the news website name in the table above that you \\nare crawling). The number of rows should be no more than 20,000 as that is our pre-set limit. \\nColumn names for this file can be URL and Status \\n2. the files it successfully downloads, a four column spreadsheet, column 1 containing the \\nURLs successfully downloaded, column 2 containing the size of the downloaded file (in \\nBytes, or you can choose your own preferred unit (bytes,kb,mb)), column 3 containing the \\n# of outlinks found, and column 4 containing the resulting content-type; name the file \\nvisit_NewsSite.csv; clearly the number of rows will be less than the number of rows in \\nfetch_NewsSite.csv \\n3. all of the URLs (including repeats) that were discovered and processed in some way; a two \\ncolumn spreadsheet where column 1 contains the encountered URL and column two an \\nindicator of whether the URL a. resides in the website (OK), or b. points outside of the website \\n(N_OK). (A file points out of the website if its URL does not start with the initial host/domain \\nname, e.g. when crawling USA Today news website all inside URLs must start with \\n.) Name the file urls_NewsSite.csv. This file will be much larger than \\nfetch_*.csv and visit_*.csv.   \\nFor example for New York Times- the URL \\n and the \\nURL \\n are both considered as residing in the same website \\nwhereas the following URL is not considered to be in the same website, \\nhttp://store.nytimes.com/ \\n \\nNote1: you should modify the crawler so it outputs the above data into three separate csv files; \\nyou will use them for processing later; \\nNote2: all uses of NewsSite above should be replaced by the name given in the column labeled \\nNewsSite Name in the table on page 1. \\nNote 3: You should denote the units in size column of visit.csv. The best way would be to write \\nthe units that you are using in column header name and let the rest of the size data be in numbers \\nfor easier statistical analysis. The hard requirement is only to show the units clearly and \\ncorrectly. \\n \\n \\nBased on the information recorded by the crawler in the output files above, you are to collate the \\nfollowing statistics for a crawl of your designated news website: \\n \\n● Fetch statistics: \\no # fetches attempted: \\nThe total number of URLs that the crawler attempted to fetch. This is usually equal to the \\nMAXPAGES setting if the crawler reached that limit; less if the website is smaller than that. \\no # fetches succeeded: \\nThe number of URLs that were successfully downloaded in their entirety, i.e. returning a \\nHTTP status code of 2XX. \\no # fetches failed or aborted: \\nThe number of fetches that failed for whatever reason, including, but not limited to: HTTP'),\n",

Therefore, these are different URLs. \\nThe page served may be the same because: \\n● that particular web server implementation treats path as case-insensitive (some server \\nimplementations do this, especially windows-based implementations) \\n● the web server implementation treats path as case-sensitive, but aliasing or redirect is being \\nused. \\nThis is one of the reasons why deduplication is necessary in practice. \\n \\n \\nQ: Attempting to compile the crawler results in syntax errors. \\nA:  Make sure that you have included crawler4j as well as all its dependencies. \\nAlso check your Java version; the code includes more recent Java constructs such as the typed \\ncollection List<String> which requires at least Java 1.5.0. \\n \\nQ: I get the following warnings when trying to run the crawler: \\n \\nlog4j: WARN No appenders could be found for logger \\nlog4j: WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly. \\n \\n \\n \\nA:  You failed to include the log4j.properties file that comes with crawler4j. \\n \\nQ:  On Windows, I am encountering the error: Exception_Access_Violation \\nA:  This is a Java issue.

(ex: Taking too much time to fetch)  \\nYou may sum up both the values and provide the combined result in the write up. \\n \\nQ: For some reason my crawler attempts 19,999 fetches, even though max pages is set to 20,000, \\ndoes this matter? \\nA: No, it doesn’t matter. It can occur because 20,000 is the limit that you will try to fetch (it may \\ncontain successful status code like 200 and other like 301). But the visit.csv will contain only the \\nURL\\'s for which you are able to successfully download the files. \\n \\nQ: How to differentiate fetched pages and downloaded pages? \\nA: In this assignment we do not ask you to save any of the downloaded files to the disk. Visiting \\na page means crawler4j processing a page (it will parse the page and extract relevant information \\nlike outgoing URLs ). That means all visited pages are downloaded. \\nYou must make sure that your crawler crawls both http and https pages of the given domain \\n \\nQ: How much time should it approximately take to crawl a website using n crawlers? \\nA: (i) Depends on your parameters set for the crawler \\n     (ii) Depends on the politeness you set in the crawler program \\nYour crawl time in hours = maxPagesToFetch / 3600 * politeness delay in seconds \\nExample: a 20,000 page fetch with a politeness delay of 2 seconds will take 11.11 hours. That is \\nassuming you are running enough threads to ensure a page fetch every 2 seconds. Therefore, it \\ncan vary for everyone. \\n \\nQ: For the third CSV file, urls_NewSite.csv, should the discovered URLs include redirect \\nURLs? \\nA: YES, if the redirect URL is the one that gets status code 300, then the URL that redirects the \\nURL to point to will be added to the scheduler of the crawler and waits to be visited. \\n \\nQ: When the URL ends with \"/\", what needs to be done? \\nA: You should filter using content type. Please have a peek into Crawler 4j code located at \\n \\n You will get a hint on how to know the content type of the page, even if the extension is not \\nexplicitly mentioned in the URL \\n \\nQ: Eclipse keeps crashing after a few minutes of running my code.

Some of them which satisfy a \\nrequirement (e.g : content type, domain, not duplicate) will be added to visit queue. But others \\nwill be dumped by the crawler.  \\nHowever, as long as the grading guideline is satisfied, we will not deduct points. \\n \\nNote#2: : 303 could be considered aborted. 404 could be considered failed.  \\nTo summarize: we consider a request to be aborted if the crawler decides to terminate that \\nrequest. Client-side timeout is an example.  Requests can fail due to reasons like content not \\nfound, server errors, etc. \\n \\nNote#3: Fetch statistics: \\n# fetches attempted: The total number of URLs that the crawler attempted to fetch. This is \\nusually equal to the MAXPAGES setting if the crawler reached that limit; less if the website is \\nsmaller than that. \\n# fetches succeeded: The number of URLs that were successfully downloaded in their entirety, \\ni.e. returning a HTTP status code of 2XX. \\n# fetches failed or aborted: The number of fetches that failed for whatever reason, including, but \\nnot limited to: HTTP redirections (3XX), client errors (4XX), server errors (5XX) and other \\nnetwork-related errors. \\nNote#4:  Consider fetches failed and aborted as same similar to as mentioned in Note#3 \\n \\nNote#5: Hint on crawling pages other than html \\nLook for how to turn ON the Binary Content in Crawling in crawler4j. Make sure you are not \\njust crawling the html parsed data and not the binary data which includes file types other than \\nhtml. \\nSearch on the internet on how to crawl binary data and I am sure you will get something on how \\nto parse pages other than html types. \\nThere will be pages other than html in almost every news site so please make sure you crawl \\nthem properly. \\n \\nQ: Regarding the content type in visit_NewsSite.csv, should we display \"text/html;charset=UTF-\\n8\" or chop out the encoding and write \"text/html\" in the Excel sheet ?  \\nA: ONLY TEXT/HTML, ignore rest. \\n \\nQ: Should we limit the URLs that the crawler attempted to fetch within the news domain? e.g. if \\nwe encounter \\n we should skip fetching by adding constraints in \\n\"shouldVisit()\"?

Programming Question: Predicting Housing Prices with Linear Regression\\nDataset: student-mat.csv\\nLink: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance\\nIn this problem, you will build a linear regression model to predict housing prices in\\nthe USA based on various features. You will use Python and scikit-learn for this\\ntask.\\n(a) Data Exploration and Pre-processing\\ni. Import the student-mat.csv dataset as a pandas DataFrame.\\nii. Select the following features: age, studytime, schoolsup, goout, Dalc,\\nWalc, health, absences, G3 (target/dependent variable). Encode the bi-\\nnary variable (schoolsup) values as 0s (no) and 1s (yes). Combine Dalc and\\nWalc into one variable alc by taking averge, then remove Dalc and Walc.\\nDisplay the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of the pre-processed dataset.\\niii. Find the number of outliers for each independent variable using the IQR\\nmethod.\\niv. Standardize and run PCA on the dataset. Create a scatterplot of PC1 vs PC2,\\ncoloring the dots by their ﬁnal grade G3. Inspect the component loadings and\\ndetermine which features contribute the most to PC1 and PC2. Keep and\\nuse standardized data for remaining problems.\\n(b) Linear Regression\\ni. Split data into training set and testing set with an 80:20 ratio. Use random\\nseed 552 for reproducibility.\\nii. Build three models using the training set: A. Linear Regression Model, B.\\nLinear Regression Model with Ridge Regularization, and C. Linear Regression\\nModel with Lasso Regularization. Set ω=0.1.\\niii. Test all three models on the test set. Find out the best performing model\\nwith repsect to each of the metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean\\nSquared Error (RMSE), and R².\\niv. How do you interpret R² values from the three models?\\nv. Print coe!cients of independent variables from the three models in one table.\\nvi. What’s the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent\\nvariable?\\nvii. How do the regularization methods di”er? What can you conclude about the\\ndataset and features given the results?\\nviii. If the regularization strength (ω) is increased, what would happen to perfor-\\nmance metrics?\\nix. What are some feature engineering methods you would suggest to improve\\nmodel performance?\\nExpected Output: Your submission should include:\\n12'),\n",
